# Bi-Disease Prediction Model

## About

This web appplication was fully developed in Python using Machine Learning libraries and environment. The model was deployed on streamlit cloud server. It predicts the diseases trained on large datasets. The datasets which were used to train the model are mentioned below.

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease          | Model Type              | Accuracy |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Diabetes         | Machine Learning Model  |  98.53%  |
| Heart Disease     | Machine Learning Model  |  98.41%  |

## NOTE

-> You can access the model at: http://localhost:8501/#diabetes-prediction-using-ml <br>
-> Python version 3.8.19 was used for the whole project. <br>

## important steps to run the model in your system

1. download the repository
2. open the command prompt in the downloaded folder
3. setup a virtual environment in the any of the code editor (i.e., VS code, Jupyter Notebook).

```
mkvvirtualenv environment_name
```

4. Install all the necessary packages and libraries in already setup virtual environment.

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

5. Create web app on streamlit cloud server and run it.

```
python biDiseasePred_public.py
```
